possible some kind of dense syntax for only specifying the logical structure of the available dialog tree. Also we could possibly express dialog flows / state machines as code..
/*
[open file] =>
{
	[fs_bookmarks] =>
		{
			for x in fs_bookmarks:
				handler(x, handle_fs_bookmark)
			while(wait_for_command(anyof([str(i) for i,x in enumerate(bookmarks)])))
				picked(i)
			
		}
}
*/
